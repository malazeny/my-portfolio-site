    <h2> Reflection</h2>
    <h3>For my optical illusion I started by creating rectangles that are spread a little apart from eachother. I then was thinking about how I would incorporate the illusion part of my project and decided that I would use the changing of colors to make it look like the shapes themselves were moving but it was actually just the colors changing slightly changing. I then added a mousePressed if statement to make change the illusion by having the rectangles farther apart and the colors different. 
    When thinking about how this optical illusion can be employed in the world it reminds me of those color blindness tests and I think this can be used in the same way with how there are different colors that sort of blend together because of how close the shapes are. </h3>
