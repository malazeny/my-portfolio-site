    <h2> Reflection</h2>
    <h3>For my game I wanted to connected to my feeling of floating through life. I think many times when I live my life I can become easy distracted and caught up in other thoughts and have to remind myself to be grounded. I wanted to show this through a game buy almost creating a grounding like exercise of being in space then transitioning to the world and lastly being underwater. 
        The process of creating this game was something that I really enjoyed and I think that I was able to learn a significant amount about p5.js and what I can truly do with it. 
        Credits: 
        For the text I used game_over and Gameplay from daFont. To scale down my rocket ship and submarine in level 1 and level 2 I used chatGPT to do the calculations to scale them down. For my confetti class to create the animation of the confetti I used https://editor.p5js.org/slow_izzm/sketches/H1fhGJSaX as a refrence</h3>
