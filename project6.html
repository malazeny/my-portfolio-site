    <h3>For my data visualization I tracked how many hours I slept for 5 consecutive days, from Monday-Friday. I did this by first creating 5 different pages that you can switch through using the right arrow key. I then created an array for how many hours I had slept and then worker on having a rectangle grow until it reached the height of how many hours I had slept. I think that this project made me realize how little or how much I had slept in a more fun and interactive way that I think represented it in a much more interesting manner. Something that I struggled with is that I wanted to be able to go back when the left key was pressed but for some reason it was not working with my code. Overall I really enjoyed this assignment and showed me how I can represent a part of my life that I usually wouldn't pay attention to in a much more interactive and fun manner.</h3>
