    <h2>For my experimental clock I decided to create a clock that is represented by a shape in the middle of the code. This color will change color, rotation, and shape based on the seconds, minutes and hours that has passed. From this assignment it really made me think about how many things we may approach in one way but it can actually be presented in many different creative ways when you just think about your own personal experiences with it. It motives me to look at things that I may not even really think about often in completely different ways.</h2>
