    <h2>To create my character I used the body of my character, which was a bear, with the head of Rainas character, an alien, and the bottom of Ireens character, a robot.
        In the end result I created a out of this world robot that has the characteristics of a natural being, the bear, an extraterrestrial, and something man made, the robotic legs. 
        To create my figure I first broke it down into three seperate funtions, the bodyGenerator, faceGenerator, and legGenerator. Then I started working on each funtion one by one to create my final character. What I struggled with the most in my code was the organization of different shapes as well as the order of them. Sometimes I wanted to have a shape in front of another but instead it was behindit and I had to play around with it until I was able to get it exactly where I wanted.</h2>
