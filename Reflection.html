    <h2> Reflection</h2>
    <h3>In this class over the past few months I have been able to learn a number of new things. While practicing with p5.js I was able to create a much better and comfortable understanding of coding. This class was a very good starting class and it game me the confidence and beginning knowledge to continue in my education of other creative coding languages!</h3>
